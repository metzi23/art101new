     <h2>Welcome!</h2>

     <p>
        I am from LA, born and raised. I am a second year UCSC student majoring in Art and minoring
        in Film and Digital Media. I hope to take what I learn and go into graphic design and work in the movie 
        or animation industry and be apart of projects that I resonate with. I also find interest in perhaps going into
        the medical field and becoming a sonographer or a type of nurse in pediatrics. In my free time, 
        I love watching Netflix, staying home, sleeping in, and watching Formula 1 or soccer games.
        I am also a dog mom to my son named ODIE.
