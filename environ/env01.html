<p>There he was, Jerry the Rock. Sleeping peacefully as the wind blows and the sun shines. 
    Opening his eyes, Jerry takes in the beauty of life, of the sky, and of his surrounding. 
    For a moment, Jerry was very happy of his life and what it had to offer him. But little did he know he would
    soon regret this very thought..</p>

        <p>But what would scare a rock?</p>
        <p>It would have to be something huge, scary, and monstrous..like a dinousaur. 
            Well with Jerry's luck, that is exactly what stands above him at the very moment.. </p>

            <p> But before he could take in the fact that this giant dinosaur was above him, a bird 
                kidnapped him and took him up, up, and away. And poor Jerry suffered some cracks. And guess
                what, the next week, he was scared by a siber tooth tiger. Jerry doesn't get breaks but 
                boy does he have stories to tell.. </p>

            <p> What awaits Jerry next...</p>
