<p>After his encounter with the Archaeopteryx, Jerry took a while before he was ready to see the outside world again. Poor Jerry
    was so scared and had also been resting from the cracks he gained. Battle scars he called them. But now as he ventured outside, once more
    Jerry was optimistic nothing would go wrong. 
    Well boy was Jerry wrong. 
    The ground beneath Jerry rumbled as the wind howeled. Could it be an Earthquake? Nope. The trembling was footsteps closing in behind him.
    And as Jerry looked up, a massive sibertooth tiger, emerged from the mist...
</p>

<div class="container">
        <p>They stared at each other, rock and beast. The tiger roared, shaking Jerry to his core (literally)</p>
        <p>As Jerry stood there, frozen, the sabertooth suddenly lunged forward, claws scraping Jerry. Fortunately for Jerry
            the sabertooth missed grabbing him completely.  </p>

            <p> Jerry expecting the creature to pounce again, prepared himself, eyes closed. But nothing happened. As he opened his eyes 
                meeting the sabertooth's again, he saw that it's eyes softened. The tiger wasn't hunting, but guarding something. 
                But what was it? Jerry intended to fugure it out but the sabertooth let out a low growl. 
                Jerry swallowed his fear and one thing he knew was that this wasn't done just yet.. </p>

            <p> What awaits Jerry next...</p>
